    h4.header A bit about me
    p Since a very young age I have been interested in the abilities of the computer. Slowly discovering them I now find myself completing a <i>Bachelor Computer Science and Engineering</i> at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a>.

    p Over the years I have been developing my skillset, expanding my field of knowledge by working on several different projects. Largest of which is a scheduler system designed for small restaurants.
